# Tactile Drawing Tool for Visually Impaired Users

Welcome to the Tactile Drawing Tool project! This tool aims to provide visually impaired users with an accessible and efficient way to interact with 3D-printed tactile drawings.

## Overview

The Tactile Drawing Tool consists of a client application and a service. The client application allows users to interact with the tool by choosing from a library of standard shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles. Additionally, users can convert text to Braille to create custom tactile drawings. The service component performs the necessary computations to translate the user's selections into tactile drawing specifications and provides useful feedback throughout the process.
